Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are what I do as Quark UI/UX Team Lead:

2. Lead team in building user and contributor friendly environment for Quark. (e.g., Make Quark introduction video)
3. Build methods to identify and solve UI/UX problems of Quark. (e.g. non-intuitive CLI)

1. Define [processes](https://quark-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/organization.html) for triage team to handle Quark issues/PRs/releases.
2. Manage triage team to handle Quark issues/PRs/releases
